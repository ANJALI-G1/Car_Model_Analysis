# Car Model Analysis ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

## Overview
This project analyzes car model data to explore trends in fuel efficiency, horsepower-to-weight ratios, and consistency over model years. Using **pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, we derive insights through data filtering, statistical measures, and visualization.

## Features
- Compute fuel efficiency metrics (`mpg`, `horsepower/weight ratio`).
- Identify car models produced over multiple years with minimal MPG variation.
- Generate insightful plots, including trend analysis and scatter plots.
- Rank vehicles based on longevity and performance.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
